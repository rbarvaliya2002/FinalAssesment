      <h2 class="section-title">History of the Game</h2>
      <p>Monopoly was first created in 1903 by a woman named Elizabeth Magie. It was called "The Landlord's Game" and was intended to teach people about the problems with monopolies and how they lead to inequality. The game was later rebranded and sold to Parker Brothers in 1935, and it quickly became one of the most popular board games in the world.</p>
    
      <h2 class="section-title">Rules of the Game</h2>
      <p>Monopoly is a game where players move around a board buying and selling properties, and collecting rent from other players who land on their properties. The game is won by bankrupting the other players and owning the most valuable properties on the board. The rules of the game can be a bit complicated, but they can be found in the official rulebook that comes with the game.</p>
