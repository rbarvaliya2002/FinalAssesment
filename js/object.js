    review: "Monopoly is a classic game that I grew up playing. I love the strategy involved in buying and trading properties, and the sense of satisfaction when you bankrupt your opponents. The only downside is that it can take a long time to play!"

    review: "I like playing Monopoly, but it can get frustrating when one player gets a lucky roll and becomes unstoppable. I also wish there were more opportunities to earn money, like through mini-games or challenges."
